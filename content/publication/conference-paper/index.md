abstract: Collaborative data analytics is becoming increasingly important due to
  the higher complexity of data science, more diverse skills from different
  disciplines, more common asynchronous schedules of team members, and the
  global trend of working remotely. In this demo we will show how Texera
  supports this emerging computing paradigm to achieve high productivity among
  collaborators with various backgrounds. Based on our active joint projects on
  the system, we use a scenario of social media analysis to show how a data
  science task can be conducted on a user friendly yet powerful platform by a
  multi-disciplinary team including domain scientists with limited coding skills
  and experienced machine learning experts. We will present how to do
  collaborative editing of a workflow and collaborative execution of the
  workflow in Texera. We will focus on data-centric features such as
  synchronization of operator schemas among the users during the construction
  phase, and monitoring and controlling the shared runtime during the execution
  phase.
